## Rustmat: A toy matrix library for Rust.

This project was developed to learn more about rust.  The [nalgebra](http://nalgebra.org/) library is probably better for actual use.  Rustmat is not guaranteed to ever be usable.

Rustmat has the following features:

* Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
* No-copy transpose and blocks of matrices
* QR and LU decompositions
